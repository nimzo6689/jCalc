A simple calculator which is created with JavaFX and Maven.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how you can develop applications with the Java FX platform using CI tools. The code is intended to mirror a simple calculator application that developers in the real work would work on. It attempts to demonstrate first-hand how you can use Java FX to effectively meet practical enterprise concerns such as productivity, agility, testability, flexibility and maintainability.

## Goals

- Demonstrate well established architectural patterns/blueprints for enterprise development with Java FX using pretty close to a real world application.
- Demonstre a build settings of CI concepts.
- Showcase some core Java EX technologies.

## Getting Started

If you simply wish to explore the code, download it as a Zip or browse the repository.
